### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](screenshot(4).png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Reading something and actually doing something with it is so different.
 

### Continued development

I want to do more practice and become more comfortable using bootstrap componenets.
 
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.gemini.com) - This helped me to understand bootstrap card componenet more deeply. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
